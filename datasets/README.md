# Input

The input data is extracted from real-world P2P botnet (Mozi) infection traffic and is saved in daily-separated `.txt` files. Each line in a file represents a P2P botnet infection interaction. Below are some examples where the first, second, third, and fourth columns, respectively, denote bot_ip, pointed_to_ip, weight, and labeled_timestamp:

| bot_ip | pointed_to_ip | weight | labeled timestamp |
